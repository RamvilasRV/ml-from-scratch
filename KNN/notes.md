KNN (classification Algorithm)

This is a classification algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the nearest data points that lie around it.
Takes the distance metric and the value of K as the paramters.

- Distance metric measure the closeness of a data point to another data point. It can be calulated using multiple methods like Euclidean distance, Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance, Cosine Similarity.
- K is the number of nearest neighbours to consider. (Rule of thumb - Start the K value with \sqrt{N}
